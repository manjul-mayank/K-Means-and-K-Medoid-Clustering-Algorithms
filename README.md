## K-Means and K-Medoid Clustering Algorithms
This repository contains a detailed Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the implementation and comparison of K-Means and K-Medoid clustering algorithms on a cancer(1).csv dataset. It serves as a practical introduction to unsupervised learning using Python, scikit-learn, and pyclustering.

## 📌 Features
* Implementation of K-Means Clustering using scikit-learn

* Implementation of K-Medoid Clustering using pyclustering

* Visual comparison of clustering results

## Performance metrics using:

* Silhouette Score

* Davies-Bouldin Index

* Calinski-Harabasz Index

Clear visualizations with matplotlib and seaborn

## 🧠 Algorithms Covered
* K-Means Clustering
- Partitions data into k clusters by minimizing intra-cluster variance.

- Sensitive to outliers and initial centroid placement.

* K-Medoid Clustering
- Similar to K-Means but uses actual data points (medoids) as cluster centers.

- More robust to outliers and noise.

## 🛠️ Dependencies
Install the required libraries using:
pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn pyclustering

## 📊 Visual Output
* Scatter plots comparing cluster assignments for both methods
* Metric scores printed and compared for insights into performance and suitability
## 🔬 Use Case
* This notebook is ideal for:

  - Students learning unsupervised learning

  - Comparing different clustering strategies

  - Understanding algorithmic sensitivity to data distribution and noise
